# docker-asterisk-16

![build](https://github.com/frankr5/docker-asterisk-16/workflows/build/badge.svg)

Docker container running Asterisk 16.30.0

Asterisk is built from source to be able to have the latest 16 version
running.

The container is build with srtp support. The recommended release 1.5.4 is used.

For srtp config.guess and config.sub are exchanged to allow the build on arm64.

## Basic configuration

The configuration included in the container is a minimal configuration that
has one endpoint with supporting configuration and this endpoint can call
extension 100 to get a hello world.

## Usage

As described above the asterisk configuration shipped with the container is
pretty basic. I would allow a simple test by registering an endpoint and
dialling 100 to hear the hello world message.

Own configurations can be either used by mapping a local configuration
directory to `/etc/asterisk` or by using the docker image in a Dockerfile:

```
FROM frank5/asterisk-16

COPY ./configuration_directory /etc/asterisk

...
```


This can be extended with stuff needed.

# TODO
